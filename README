This project reads from a HAM radio D710 and broadcasts HAM radio packet data over a TCP socket server.

To run such the server, the D710 Python logger must be run first, compatible for both Windows and Macs,
	it writes incoming packets to a log file.

The main server can then be run, and will broadcast the packet data in a json format over the local area,
	using a 54730-9 port.
